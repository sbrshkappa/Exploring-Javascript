Here's a list of all my learnings in javascript as I explore and learn more. I will complie some of these into detail blogs at a later point.

## Web Concepts for JS Developers

- Viewport control with meta tag tells the browser how to resize content based on the device width and height
    ```<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">```

## JS Concepts

- Call: Borrows a function and reassigns 'this' to a value that is provided.
- Apply: Similar to the Call functionlity but uses an Array list for arugments.
- Bind: Returns a function that uses a this value set to the provided value in the arguments.

- Debouncing: A function that limits the number of times a certain function runs, by forcing a function to wait a certain amount of time before running again.
              See example code in debounce.js

## Polyfills

- What is a polyfill? A script that adds/updates new functions is called "Polyfill". It's meant to fill the gap and add missing implementations.
