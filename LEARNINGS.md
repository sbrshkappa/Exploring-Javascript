Here's a list of all my learnings in javascript as I explore and learn more. I will complie some of these into detail blogs at a later point.


## Javascript Methods

- Call: Borrows a function and reassigns 'this' to a value that is provided.
- Apply: Similar to the Call functionlity but uses an Array list for arugments.
- Bind: Returns a function that uses a this value set to the provided value in the arguments.

## Polyfills

- What is a polyfill? A script that adds/updates new functions is called "Polyfill". It's meant to fill the gap and add missing implementations.
